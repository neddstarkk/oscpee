1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,360
Virtualization has drastically
changed to our modern data

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,116
centers.

3
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:07,490
We used to have
data centers that

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,030
may have 100 individual
servers in them,

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,550
and of course, all of
those individual servers

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,460
were all connected together
with enterprise switches

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,560
and we connected all
of the separate VLANs

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,690
together with
enterprise routers.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,700
And of course, there
was redundancy,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,460
so we always had multiple
switches and multiple

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,970
routers to ensure there was
up time to these services.

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,460
And then we virtualized
the data center.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,340
We removed those
100 physical devices

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,040
and created them all
virtually within one

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,860
single large physical system.

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,360
So now that all of
these servers are

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,580
living in this
virtual world, how

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,310
do we provide switching
and routing services

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,850
for all of those networks
and all of those VLANs?

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,160
Of course, all of those
hundreds of servers

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,110
that are now
virtualized will still

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,960
need to be able to communicate
to the physical world.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,850
The component that
provides this link

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,760
between the virtual world
and the physical world

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,230
is the hypervisor.

26
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,910
You might also hear
this referred to

27
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,490
as the Virtual Machine Manager.

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,560
This is the component
that manages

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,030
the entire virtual platform for
all of those virtual servers.

30
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,730
If you're running a virtual
machine on your existing

31
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,450
desktop, you may want to be sure
that the hypervisor is using

32
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,420
a CPU that could
support virtualization

33
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,000
within the hardware of the CPU.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Intel calls this VT for
virtualization technology,

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,810
and AMD calls it AMDV
for the virtualization.

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,790
This hypervisor is the component
in this virtual system that

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,400
is maintaining all
of these virtual CPUs

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,030
to all of these devices.

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,110
It's allowing you to set up
separate networking components,

40
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,446
and it can provide security for
all of these virtual machines.

41
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,570
There are a lot of different
options for networking

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,390
when you get into
the virtual world.

43
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,220
A lot of these
hypervisors will have

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,590
their own internal
network, so they

45
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,170
can communicate to
all of the local VMs

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,050
without ever using
an external network.

47
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,270
You could also use
a shared address

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,370
to communicate outside
of the virtual machine.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,100
So there might be
a single Ethernet

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,860
card on this virtual
machine platform

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,180
and the hundreds of VMs that
are inside of this device

52
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,040
will use that single
IP address associated

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,380
with that interface
as the connection

54
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,890
to the outside world.

55
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,270
This effectively is performing
a network address translation

56
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,904
function to be able to use and
share that single IP address.

57
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:32,570
You can also configure
a virtual machine

58
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,210
to have its own IP address
rather than sharing

59
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,710
a single natted address.

60
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,230
This would be a bridged
network address,

61
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,800
and it will allow the VM to
have its own unique addressing.

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,840
And some virtual machines
can be configured

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,852
with a private address that
doesn't communicate to anyone.

64
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:49,310
This is very common
to do if you're

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,820
setting up a virtual machine
in a test environment.

66
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,740
But now that all
of these servers

67
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,080
have been put into a
virtual environment,

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,750
we can also build out
switches and routers

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,940
in this virtual
environment as well.

70
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,430
In this scenario,
I've got a dotted line

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,590
around this virtual
world that we've

72
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,460
created with these hundreds of
different servers inside of it.

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,250
And of course, there is a
link to the outside world

74
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,370
that eventually will connect
to a physical switch.

75
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,470
Inside of this virtual
world, I built out

76
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,240
a couple of virtual
switches that

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,610
are connecting to
these virtual servers,

78
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,530
and I've also got
a virtual router

79
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,860
that's able to route between
these different networks.

80
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,930
Because this is a
virtual environment,

81
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,120
I can make changes
at any time just

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,130
by making a few mouse clicks.

83
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,620
These virtual switches
and virtual routers

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,810
are all software that's running
in this virtual environment.

85
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,950
So if I'd like to put a back
end process for this server that

86
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,290
happens to have a
separate database server,

87
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,930
I can simply add a
different virtual switch

88
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,640
and now I've got a
way for this server

89
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,210
to communicate on the back
end to a separate database.

90
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,210
Just as I've added virtual
networking components,

91
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,730
I can also add virtual
security components.

92
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,920
I could add a virtual firewall.

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,690
So I can have a
firewall protecting

94
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,350
all of the data that's going in
and out of this virtual world.

95
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,980
I can also bring the
security down to a port level

96
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,500
and add multiple
virtual firewalls,

97
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,440
so I'm able to have a
very specific security

98
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,930
policy for every
single link that's

99
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,310
going in and out of every server
in this virtual environment.

100
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,890
There are certainly
advantages and disadvantages

101
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,290
to all of these
different configurations.

102
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,450
But when you're working
with a virtual environment,

103
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,480
you have the flexibility to
build the environment exactly

104
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,250
with the resources and
requirements that you need.
