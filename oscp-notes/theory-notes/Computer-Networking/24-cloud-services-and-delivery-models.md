# 24. Cloud Services and Delivery Models

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

* On-demand software
  * No local installation
  * Why manage your own email distribution? Or payroll?
* Central management of data and applications
  * Your data is out there
* A complete application offering
  * No development work required
  * Google Mail

## Infrastructure as a service (Iaas)

* Sometimes called Hardware as a Service (Haas)
  * Outsource your equipment
* You're still responsible for the management
  * And for the security
* Your data is out there, but more within your control

## Platform as a service (Paas)

* No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC
  * Someone else handles the platform, you handle the development
* You don't have direct control of the data, people, or infrastructure
  * Trained security professionals are watching your stuff.
    * Choose carefully
* Put the building blocks together
  * Develop your app from what's available on the platform
  * SalesForce.com

## Cloud Deployment Models

* Private
  * Your own virtualized data center
* Public
  * Available to everyone on the internet
* Hybrid
  * A mix of public and private
* Community
  * Several organizations share the same resources

## Local and Cloud resources

* On-premise
  * Your applications are on local hardware
  * Your servers are in your data center in your building
* Hosted
  * Your servers are not in your building
  * They may not even be running on your hardware
  * Usually a specialized computing environment
* Cloud
  * Entire application instances can be created and torn down on-demand
  * Resources are available as needed

## Connecting to the Cloud

* Existing internet connection
  * Browser-based, SSL encryption
* VPN (Virtual Private Network)
  * Encrypted tunnel for all traffic between you and the cloud
  * Will probably require some additional hardware on both ends
* Direct connection
  * Co-location, same shared data center
  * High speed, 10 Gigabit connection
  * No external traffic, high security

## Managing Cloud Security Policies

* Clients are at work, data is in the cloud
  * How do you keep everything secure?
  * The organization already has well-defined policies
* How do you make your security policies work in the cloud?
  * Integrate a CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)
  * Implemented as client software, local security appliances, or cloud-based security solutions

## Clous Access Security Broker (CASB)

* Visibility
  * Determine what apps are in use
  * Are they authorized to use the apps?
* Compliance
  * Are users complying with HIPAA? PCI?
* Threat Prevention
  *  Allow access by authorized users, prevent attacks
* Data Security
  * Ensure that all data transfers are encrypted
  * Protect the transfer of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) with DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
