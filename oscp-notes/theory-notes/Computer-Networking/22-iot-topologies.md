# 22. Internet-of-Things Topologies

## IoT (Internet of Things)

* Wearable technology
  * Watches, health monitors, glasses
  * Track our location
  * Where is that data and how is it stored?
* Home automation
  * Video doorbells
  * Internet-connected garage door openers
  * Heating and cooling
  * It knows when you are home (and when you aren't)

## Z-Wave

* Home automation networking
  * Control lights, locks, garage doors, etc.
* Wireless mesh networking
  * Nodes can hop through other nodes on the way to destination
* Uses the ISM band
  * Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
  * 900 MHz frequencies in the US
  * No conflicts with 802.11

## ANT/ANT+

* Wireless sensor network protocol
  * 2.4 GHz ISM band (industrial, scientific, and medical)
  * An "Internet of Things" ultra-low-power protocol
  * Fitness devices, heart rate monitors, etc. 
* A separate wireless service
  * Not 802.11 or Bluetooth
* Denial of service
  * Spectrum jamming
* Optional encryption
  * And no method to maintain integrity

## Bluetooth

* High speed communication over short distances
  * PAN (Personal Area Network)
* Connects our mobile devices
  * Smartphone
  * Tethering
  * Headsets and headphones
  * Health monitors
  * Automobiles and phone integration
  * Smartwatches
  * External speakers

## Near Field Communication (NFC)

* Two-way wireless communication
  * Build on RFID, which is mostly one-way
* Payment Systems
  * Major credit cards
  * Online wallets
* Bootstrap for other wireless
  * NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing
* Access token, identity "card"
  * Short range with encryption support

## IR (Infrared)

* Included on many smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches
  * Not really used for file transfers and printing
* Control your entertainment center
  * Many IR options

## RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

* It's everywhere
  * Access badges
  * Inventory/assembly line tracking
  * Pet/animal identification
  * Anything that needs to be tracked
* Radar technology
  * Radio energy transmitted to the tag
  * RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
  * Bidirectional communication
  * Some tag formats can be active/powered

## IEEE 802.11

* Wireless networking (802.11)
  * Managed by IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)
* Many updates over time
  * Check with IEEE for the latest
* The Wi-Fi trademark
  * Wi-Fi alliance handles interoperability testing
