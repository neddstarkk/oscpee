1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,110
By far, Ethernet is the most
popular network topology

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,950
in the world.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,400
Somebody has a network, and they
have some flavor of Ethernet

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,420
that they're using
in their environment.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,210
And there are many
different types

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,760
of Ethernet running different
speeds, different types

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,860
of cabling, different
types of connector

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,110
and different types
of network switches.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,500
In the past, we may have run
ethernet over coaxial cables,

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,290
but these days most
modern Ethernet networks

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,030
will be using twisted pair
cabling or fiber optic.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,940
If you're running 100 megabit
Ethernet over twisted pair

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,492
cables, then you are
using 100BASE-TX.

14
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:38,950
You'll sometimes
hear this referred

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,420
to as fast Ethernet, which is
what we called 100 megabit when

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,430
it was released after using 10
megabit Ethernet for so long.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,460
100BASE-TX uses category 5
or better twisted pair copper

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,070
cabling, and it uses
two of the pair that

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,350
are inside of that cable.

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,000
It does not use all four
pair to communicate.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,830
And the maximum
length of a cable

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,530
run for the 100BASE-TX standard
is 100 meters in length.

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,870
Moving up from 100
megabit Ethernet,

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,980
we move into gigabit
Ethernet or 1000 megabit.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,630
The standard for
gigabit Ethernet

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,810
that most people are
using is 1000BASE-T.

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,980
1000BASE-T gigabit Ethernet runs
over category 5 twisted pair

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,310
cable or better.

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,670
If you look at the
EIA TIA standard,

30
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,430
you'll see that category
three, four, and five cable

31
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,820
is deprecated.

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,730
So usually the minimum
cable that you'll

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,280
find available to run for
1000BASE-T is category 5e.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,110
And instead of
using the two pairs

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,600
that we used for 100
megabit Ethernet,

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,300
our 1000BASE-T gig
Ethernet requires

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,370
that we use all four pairs
inside of that twisted pair

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,200
of cabling.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,100
If you need to run Ethernet
pass that 100 meter

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,380
limitation for copper
cabling, then you'll

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,900
probably want to connect
equipment using fiber.

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,420
And of course, there are
gigabit Ethernet standards

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,800
for fiber optics.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,070
One of these standards
is 1000BASE-SX.

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,820
This is gigabit Ethernet running
at 1000 megabits per second

46
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,930
using what's called NIR or
near infrared light bandwidth.

47
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,630
The standard commonly
uses multi-mode fiber

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,630
as it's physical medium, so
we can extend this Ethernet

49
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,220
connection generally 220 to
about 500 meters in length

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,040
depending on the type of
fiber that we're using.

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,870
For much longer
ethernet connections,

52
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,740
you may want to use 1000BASE-LX,
which is gig Ethernet using

53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,780
a long wave length laser.

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,780
You could run 1000BASE-LX
over multi-mode fiber,

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,060
and you get about
550 meters in length.

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,090
But if you really need
to extend the length up

57
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,570
to five kilometers,
you can use 1000BASE-LX

58
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,300
over single mode fiber.

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,030
If you're really looking to
push the throughput of copper

60
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,570
cabling, you can run 10
gig Ethernet over copper

61
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,060
or the 10GBASE-T standard.

62
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,450
This uses frequencies up
to 500 megahertz inside

63
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,520
of this cable, which
is well above what

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,350
we use for our gig Ethernet
connections of 125 megahertz.

65
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,240
Because of that,
we will need cable

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,910
that's specifically designed
to support these higher

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,030
frequencies.

68
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,410
So for 10GBASE-T, you'll be
able to get 55 meters in length.

69
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,680
If you're using cat
6 cable, you can

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,460
upgrade to category 6, which
stands for augmented, if you

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,639
need to go to 100 meters.

72
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,930
And if you need additional
shielding from interference,

73
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,330
you can choose a
category 7 cable

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,210
that is shielding not only
the entire cable itself,

75
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,440
but each individual
pairs of wire.
