161
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,620
step is going to be talking to this root
server the root server is going to

162
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,630
server the root server is going to
 

163
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,660
server the root server is going to
respond back and say if you're looking

164
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:25,670
respond back and say if you're looking
 

165
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,180
respond back and say if you're looking
for anything with a.com you need to go

166
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,190
for anything with a.com you need to go
 

167
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,849
for anything with a.com you need to go
to the dot-com name server so the next

168
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:30,859
to the dot-com name server so the next
 

169
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,979
to the dot-com name server so the next
step will be the local name server will

170
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:32,989
step will be the local name server will
 

171
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,039
step will be the local name server will
talk to the dot-com DNS server this

172
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,049
talk to the dot-com DNS server this
 

173
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,170
talk to the dot-com DNS server this
server will have a list of where my

174
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,180
server will have a list of where my
 

175
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,970
server will have a list of where my
local DNS server is for

176
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:39,980
local DNS server is for
 

177
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,610
local DNS server is for
professormesser.com and it will provide

178
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:42,620
professormesser.com and it will provide
 

179
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,740
professormesser.com and it will provide
that information to the local name

180
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:44,750
that information to the local name
 

181
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,259
that information to the local name
server the local name server will then

182
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:47,269
server the local name server will then
 

183
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,930
server the local name server will then
query the professormesser.com name

184
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:49,940
query the professormesser.com name
 

185
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,449
query the professormesser.com name
server which obviously will have the IP

local name server at this point the
 

195
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,490
local name server at this point the
local name server will let the resolver

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:03,500
local name server will let the resolver
 

197
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,530
local name server will let the resolver
know what that IP address happens to be
