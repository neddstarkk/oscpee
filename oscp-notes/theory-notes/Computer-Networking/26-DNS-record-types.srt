WWE my domain name your DNS server will
 

145
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,660
WWE my domain name your DNS server will
recognize that this is a canonical name

146
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:55,670
recognize that this is a canonical name
 

147
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,850
recognize that this is a canonical name
it will associate it with the primary

it will associate it with the primary
 

149
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,190
it will associate it with the primary
name of this device and then perform the

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
name of this device and then perform the
 

151
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,580

services on your network for example you
 

157
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,240
services on your network for example you
could create a service record or SRV

158
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,250
could create a service record or SRV
 

159
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,430
could create a service record or SRV
