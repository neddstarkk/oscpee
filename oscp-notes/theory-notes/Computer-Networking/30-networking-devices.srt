1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,280
If you're an early user of
Ethernet over twisted pair

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,550
cabling, then you are probably
connecting all of your devices

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,840
with a hub.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,500
You'll often hear a hub referred
to as a multi port repeater.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,750
That's because the
operation of a hub

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,880
means that any
traffic going into one

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,670
of these single ports of
the hub will automatically

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,340
be regenerated out of
every other port that

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,260
happens to be on that hub.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,750
This makes for a very
simple forwarding mechanism.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,270
If traffic goes into
the hub, it comes out

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,970
of the hub on every
other interface.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,680
Since there are no
forwarding decisions

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,570
to be made inside
of a hub, we often

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,560
say that this is a device
that's operating at OSI layer 1.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,660
Because all devices
are effectively

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,720
sharing this network, that
means that you can't really

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,780
have a full duplex connection
to any other device

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,890
on this network.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,990
All devices connected
to a hub are

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,350
going to be running at
half duplex by default.

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,680
This also means that if more
devices begin communicating

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,980
more often, there will be an
increasing number of collisions

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,160
on this half duplex network,
which means the more traffic

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,860
increases, the less efficient
this network will be.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,010
If you're using a
gigabit Ethernet network,

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,590
then you're not
communicating using a hub.

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,210
Hubs are only
available if you're

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,620
running 10 megabit Ethernet
or 100 megabit Ethernet.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,320
As you can tell, the
technology behind the hub

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,810
is very simplistic.

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,850
It's not really designed for
today's high speed networks.

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,700
Hubs are no longer manufactured,
and it's even difficult

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,610
to find them these days
on the secondary markets.

35
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,850
Imagine if you had a switch
that only had two ports on it.

36
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,080
You had a network on
one side of the switch

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,530
and you had a network on the
other side of the switch.

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,020
In the early days of networking,
you would have a bridge.

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,800
A bridge is making forwarding
decisions in software

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,540
based on the MAC
addresses of what

41
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,660
happens to be on both
sides of that bridge.

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,760
We would commonly use
these bridges to connect

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,846
two separate physical networks.

44
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,720
These networks could be
different typologies.

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,290
So we might be connecting
an Ethernet network

46
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,390
to a token ring network by
putting a bridge in the middle.

47
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,310
But we might also
use these bridges

48
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,169
to connect similar typologies.

49
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,539
You could take a very
large Ethernet network

50
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,090
and split it into two
pieces to minimize

51
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,970
the number of collisions
that might be occurring.

52
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,900
Just like today's
modern switches,

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,830
these older style bridges
would make forwarding decisions

54
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,580
based on the destination MAC
address inside of a frame.

55
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,350
A good example of
a modern bridge

56
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,020
that would be connecting
different types of networks

57
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,450
would be today's
wireless access points.

58
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,160
You would have a
wireless network

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,700
on one side of this access
point and a wired Ethernet

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,020
network on the other.

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,090
And you're bridging between
these two different typologies.

62
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,640
Our modern switches are an
evolution from the older style

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,510
bridges.

64
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,480
Now we have devices with
hundreds of interfaces

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,330
on the front, rather than
two or four that you might

66
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,280
have on a traditional bridge.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,920
Also, a traditional bridge was
making all of its forwarding

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,630
decisions in software.

69
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,780
On today's switches, we are
making all of these decisions

70
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,150
in the hardware of
these device using

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,170
a technology known as ASICs, or
Application Specific Integrated

72
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,400
Circuits.

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,710
The forwarding decisions
on our modern switches

74
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,870
are exactly the same as
the forwarding decisions

75
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,120
that were made on the
older style bridges.

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,490
We're looking at the
destination MAC address

77
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,560
and we're forwarding the
frame depending on where

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,020
that MAC address needs to go.

79
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,620
Our modern switches also have
a number of additional features

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,670
available to them.

81
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,100
One good example is
power over Ethernet,

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,890
where you could plug in a
device that requires power,

83
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,570
and it can receive
power directly

84
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,700
from your network switch.

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,070
Some switches might
also include the option

86
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,280
to enable a routing
functionality within exactly

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
the same chassis.

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,090
We call this functionality
multi-layer switching.

89
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,300
You might hear it referred
to as a Layer 3 switch.

90
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,490
That's because there's a
portion of the switch that

91
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,440
is performing the normal
Layer 2 switching function.

92
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
And there's another portion
of the switch that's

93
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,930
able to route between
the different VLANs that

94
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,620
are connected to that switch.

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,390
If a device is a
router, then it's

96
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,540
forwarding traffic between
different IP subnets.

97
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,310
And it's making its
forwarding decisions

98
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,590
based on the destination
IP address that

99
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,900
might be in that IP packet.

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,330
If it's a switch, then we're
making forwarding decisions

101
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,230
based on a MAC address.

102
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,550
That's why we refer to
routers as Layer 3 devices

103
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,130
and switches as Layer 2 devices.

104
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,410
Routers will often
connect different types

105
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,820
of network typologies.

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,310
On one side, you might
have an Ethernet network

107
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,600
running over fiber.

108
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
And on the other
side of the router,

109
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,835
it might be a wide area network
that's running over copper.

110
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,060
You generally don't
connect to any network

111
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,850
these days without
a firewall in place.

112
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,520
Firewalls make decisions
about whether traffic

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,310
is allowed or not allowed
through the network based

114
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,180
on Layer 4 information.

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,500
This might be a TCP
or UDP port number.

116
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,170
Modern firewalls
take that even higher

117
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,240
and can look into the
application that's

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,790
going across the network
and make decisions on

119
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,520
whether certain applications
are allowed or not.

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,700
We often refer to those
as Layer 7 firewalls,

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,340
or next generation firewalls.

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,040
Many firewalls also
provide other features.

123
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,100
You could configure your
firewall as a VPN endpoint

124
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,290
at your main location,
and configure

125
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,830
another firewall as a VPN
endpoint at a remote site.

126
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,360
That will allow
you to encrypt all

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,310
of the traffic that flows
between the main location

128
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,520
and any of your remote sites.

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
Some firewalls can be
configured as a proxy.

130
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,350
So they'll stop the
network communication,

131
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,900
make the request on your
behalf, receive the response,

132
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,680
make sure the response is
appropriate for you to receive,

133
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,800
and then send that traffic
down to your workstation.

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Many firewalls can also be
configured as a Layer 3 device.

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,650
So they can route all
of the traffic going

136
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,360
in and out of the internet.

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,090
So not only are they
making security decisions

138
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,230
based on Layer 4 UDP/TCP
port numbers or Layer 7

139
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,540
applications, but
they can also act

140
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,020
as a router to send traffic
between different IP subnets.

141
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,520
In many enterprise
networks, we'd

142
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,790
use wireless access points
to be able to connect people

143
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,510
to a wireless network.

144
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,450
This is a little different
than the wireless

145
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,090
router you might have
in a home office that

146
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,270
has the router, the
switch, the wireless access

147
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,420
point, the firewall, and some
other components within it

148
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,360
as well.

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,200
If you were able to pull
out just the wireless piece,

150
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,050
you would have a
wireless access point.

151
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,840
As we mentioned earlier,
a wireless access point

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
is a Layer 2 device.

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,430
It's effectively a bridge
between a wireless network

154
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,020
and an Ethernet network.

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,440
Many organizations will deploy
many wireless access points

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,480
throughout multiple
floors of a building

157
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,220
so that you can
always be connected

158
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,750
to the wireless network.

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,260
The device we call
a modem is named

160
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,340
after the modulator/demodulator
function that is happening

161
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,180
inside of this device.

162
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,450
It's very common to have
modems, for example,

163
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,400
on traditional phone lines.

164
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,520
If devices in two locations
needed to communicate,

165
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,710
they could put a
modem on each side

166
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,590
and communicate over
traditional phone lines.

167
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,720
These phone lines have limited
frequencies that are available,

168
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,080
and therefore, there's a
limited amount of bandwidth

169
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,320
that you could send between
those two locations.

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,250
You'll sometimes see modems
used as a secondary, or backup,

171
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,060
system to use the plain old
telephone service or the POTS

172
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,490
system to be able
to communicate when

173
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,060
all other forms of
communication are unavailable.

174
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,770
If you have DSL
in your location,

175
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,470
then you're probably
connecting to the DSL network

176
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,420
using a DSL modem.

177
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,480
If you have broadband internet
from your cable company,

178
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,970
they will provide you
with a cable modem.

179
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,540
Although technically, a cable
modem is more of a bridge

180
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,630
than it is a modem.

181
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,540
Sometimes you just need to
convert between different types

182
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,890
of network media.

183
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,690
You don't need to make
forwarding decisions

184
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,950
based on a Layer 2 MAC address
or a Layer 3 IP address.

185
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,290
You're really just looking
to change communication

186
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,960
from running over a
copper network to a fiber,

187
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,000
and perhaps back again.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,550
In those scenarios, you might
want to use a media converter.

189
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,880
This is a good example
of a media converter.

190
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,010
This operates at OSI Layer 1.

191
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,200
It's simply changing
the physical layer

192
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,460
from a copper network to a
fiber network or vise versa.

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,530
You might use one of
these media converters

194
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,320
if you need to extend the
communication over a very

195
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,460
long distance.

196
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,410
We know that Ethernet
can support up

197
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,810
to 100 meters of communication.

198
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,030
But if you need to go
kilometers in distance,

199
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,760
you might want to include a
media converter to convert

200
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,059
to fiber, extended it
over that long distance,

201
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,130
and then, perhaps,
convert it back to copper

202
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,985
on the other end.

203
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,360
You could also
use this if you've

204
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,429
been provided with
fiber connections,

205
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,310
but your switch only
supports copper connections.

206
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,050
You could use the
media converter

207
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,540
to convert from fiber
to copper to provide

208
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,800
that connection to the switch.

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,380
This is usually an active
conversion that's taking place.

210
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,820
So these devices very
commonly need to be powered.

211
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,710
You don't generally
see a device that's

212
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,130
converting from fiber to copper
without some type of power

213
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,910
source being connected.

214
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,810
In fact, it's not uncommon to
see rack-based media converters

215
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,630
like this one that have
central power supplies that

216
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,890
provide power to all of these
different media converters.

217
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,190
Our wireless networks
never seem to extend as far

218
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,640
as we would like them to go.

219
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,970
That's because sometimes,
we don't have a choice where

220
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,620
we put an access point.

221
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,380
There might be a single room
where we have an Ethernet

222
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,360
connection, and
that's the only place

223
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,840
available to plug in that
wireless access point.

224
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,550
With a wireless
range extender, you

225
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,770
can increase the size of
that wireless network.

226
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,010
You can think of this as
a wireless repeater that's

227
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,140
able to receive
a wireless signal

228
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,710
and then repeat that
signal to a local area.

229
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,690
Here's how this
wireless range extender

230
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,520
might work in a typical house.

231
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,820
Let's say that your cable modem
connection comes into a family

232
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,580
room, and that's the only
place available to put

233
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,960
a wireless access point.

234
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,270
We'll put it up
high on this shelf.

235
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,030
And it might cover a
certain area of the house.

236
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,910
But you can see that the
kitchen and the master bedroom

237
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,390
don't have any coverage.

238
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,350
So we might install a
wireless range extender

239
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,290
right in the middle, maybe
in this hallway upstairs.

240
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,180
And when we turn that
on, we can extend

241
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,300
that wireless signal to
cover more of this house

242
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,820
just by adding that
single repeater

243
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,040
right in the middle
of the communication.

244
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,950
Remarkably, voice
communication continues

245
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,410
to be something
we use even today.

246
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,980
We are using different ways to
communicate over these voice

247
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,370
type networks by using
voice over IP telephones

248
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,880
or other types of software-based
voice over IP endpoints.

249
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,350
This means we now have options.

250
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,680
We can use voice over
IP instead of using

251
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,560
the traditional plain old
telephone service or POTS

252
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,310
lines.

253
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,770
And we could use different
types of platforms

254
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,680
to be able to send this
voice over IP communication.

255
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,140
We could use a traditional
physical handset,

256
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,780
or we could use software
that's built into a browser,

257
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,200
or on our mobile devices.
