1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,630
All of the devices on our
network have their own clock.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,330
This would be every server,
every router, every switch,

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,180
every workstation, and
every other device.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,410
There is usually log files,
authentication details,

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,870
anything dealing with
logging of information

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,110
is all using the date
and time that is gathered

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,670
from this clock information.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,090
So, having this synchronized
across all of these devices

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,140
is very important.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,390
That would allow you
to compare log files

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,990
across multiple devices to
track exactly what's going on

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,310
in your environment.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,320
And, of course, you would like
this to occur automatically.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,710
You don't want to have to
go into every single device

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,130
and update the clock or have
to update the clock every time

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,960
the device is rebooted.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,230
Fortunately, we're able
to do this using NTP--

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,390
or the Network Time Protocol.

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,260
This allows us to configure
our devices with an NTP server

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,200
and then they can check
in to that NTP server

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,300
to update their clocks
on a regular basis.

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,070
This is an extremely accurate
way of updating these clocks.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,880
Usually, the accuracy is
better than one millisecond

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,220
when you're updating
the clocks with an NTP

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,870
server on your local network.

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,050
If you're configuring
NTP on your network

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,510
you may want to have
an internal NTP server.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,300
This is a server
that is in charge

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,640
of the clock for all
of the devices that

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,150
need to get updates.

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,920
And as an NTP server, it
does not modify its own time.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,260
An NTP client is
a device that will

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,990
request these times
from the NTP server

34
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,600
and then update their
clocks accordingly.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,620
Sometimes a device can be
both an NTP client and an NTP

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,340
server.

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,950
So it can update its time
based on the time that

38
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,190
may be available on a
more accurate NTP server

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,640
and then it can provide those
updates to other NTP clients

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,150
on your network.

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,540
If you're planning to configure
this on your network then

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,440
you need to decide what devices
will be NTP clients, which

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,610
will be NTP servers, and which
devices may be both an NTP

44
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,910
client and an NTP server.

45
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,300
We can associate a
value with an NTP server

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,200
that designates how far it is
away from the original time

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,920
source.

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,310
We call these stratum
layers in NTP.

49
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,320
That's because the
original reference

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,540
clock would be stratum 0.

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,270
This might be an atomic
clock or a GPS clock

52
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,680
that you've configured.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,990
The next server
away from stratum 0

54
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,090
would be a stratum
1 server, which

55
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,870
is going to be obtaining its
timestamp from a stratum 0

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
server.

57
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,070
You might also have stratum 2
servers on your network, which

58
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,400
are going to be receiving their
timestamps from a stratum 1

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,870
server.

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,790
On your client
workstations you generally

61
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,440
would configure your NTP client,
which may specify an IP address

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,280
or the domain name of a
particular NTP server.

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,990
And if this is inside
of your network

64
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,560
you may want to specify your
own internal IP addresses.

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,410
You can also use
multiple NTP servers just

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,970
in case one of those
is not available.

67
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,140
If this NTP service is going to
be on your own internal network

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,090
you'll need at
least one NTP server

69
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,040
to act as the clock source.

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,250
You'll also specify in the
configuration of that NTP

71
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,470
server what stratum this
device happens to be.

72
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,890
So, if a client has the
choice of synchronizing itself

73
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,190
with an NTP server that
has a stratum level of two

74
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,670
and another NTP server that
has a stratum level of one

75
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,560
it will choose to
synchronize itself

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,930
with the server that has
the lower stratum number

77
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,560
or the stratum level one.
