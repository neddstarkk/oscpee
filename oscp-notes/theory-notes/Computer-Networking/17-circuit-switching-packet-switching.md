# 17. Circuit Switching and Packet Switching

## Circuit Switching

* Circuit is established between endpoints before data passes
  * Like a phone call
* Nobody else can use the circuit when it's idle
  * Inefficient use of resources
* Connection is always there
  * It's mine. You can't use it
* POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)
* ISDN
  * Use a phone number to call another ISDN modem

## Packet Switching

* Data is grouped into packets
  * Voice, data, video, etc.
  * Like a network
* The media is usually shared
  * Someone else can use it, even when you don't
* One connection may have more bandwidth allocated than another
  * How much money would you like to spend?
* SONET, ATM
* DSL
* Frame Relay
* MPLS
* Cable Modem
* Satellite
* Wireless
